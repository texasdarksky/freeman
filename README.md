# Getting Started

This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) project to visualize the dark sky using a Unihedron SQM located at the Freeman Center (Ranch) of Texas State University.

## Clone the project and install packages

```bash
# clone project
git clone git@github.com:texasdarksky/freeman.git

# install dependencies
cd freeman

# with npm
npm i 

# with pnpm

pnpm i
```

## Developing

Start the development server:

```bash
# with npm
npm run dev


# with pnpm
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
# with npm
npm run build


# with pnpm
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview` or `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
